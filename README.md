# Paper Reading

This repo is created to record the papers I have readed, also I will put some useful blogs from other platforms to help you to understand these papers. And the papers I read mainly focus on LLM/AI4Science/Graph Model, more details about my taste could be viewed on my [personal website](https://iamb3st.github.io/).
